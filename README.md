## Glossary

AIP is a publication containing information essential to air navigation. The structure and contents of AIPs are standardized by international agreement through ICAO. AIPs normally have three parts â€“ GEN (general), ENR (en route) and AD (aerodromes).

AIPs are kept up-to-date by regular revision on a fixed cycle. For operationally significant changes in information, the cycle known as the AIRAC (Aeronautical Information Regulation And Control) cycle is used: revisions are produced every 56 days (double AIRAC cycle) or every 28 days (single AIRAC cycle).

EUROCONTROL has published a specification for an electronic AIP (eAIP). The eAIP Specification aims to harmonise the structure and presentation of AIPs for digital media.
